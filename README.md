# Portafolio cotizador 

Hi I'm Manuel Medina
This is an app developed in Nodejs and Express with the goal to show 
the things i can make on Javascript,Nodejs, Php

### Spanish
the interface interaction are written on spanish  this is 
because i'm a native spanish speaker , this portfolio will be present to rrhh in spanish and spanish developers in latinoamerica 
Note: i may slip some spanish reference in the code just ignore it 

a reason for uploading theses projects on github is to allow the people take the code, download it and see my work, and let the peoble who are interested on it download it and add whatever they want
